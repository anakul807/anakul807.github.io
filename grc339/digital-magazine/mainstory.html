				<h2>Nintendo Entertainment System: The Console That Started It All</h2>
				<p>
					When the NES arrived in North America in 1985, it wasn’t just a console—it was a revival of an entire industry. Following the video game crash of 1983, few believed home gaming could thrive again. But Nintendo’s strategy of quality control, innovative design, and unforgettable titles gave players confidence. With its simple gray box design and an intuitive rectangular controller, the NES became instantly recognizable.
				</p>

				<p>
					The console’s success was driven by iconic games that defined genres. *Super Mario Bros.* introduced side-scrolling platforming at a scale no one had seen before. *The Legend of Zelda* offered an expansive world filled with mystery and adventure, while *Metroid* introduced players to atmospheric exploration and non-linear gameplay. Each cartridge felt like a gateway into a new universe, and kids of the era still remember the ritual of blowing into the cartridge to make it work.

                <p>
					Beyond the games, the NES redefined how people thought of play at home. It turned the living room TV into a shared space for entertainment. Families gathered around to take turns on *Duck Hunt* with the Zapper accessory, and friends raced through *Excitebike* courses. The system encouraged both solo adventures and social competition.
				</p>

				<p>
					By the time production ended, the NES had sold over 60 million units worldwide, cementing Nintendo as the leader in the industry. More importantly, it created a foundation of trust, nostalgia, and innovation that Nintendo continues to build upon decades later. For many, the NES wasn’t just a console—it was the beginning of a lifelong love for video games.
